# EECS168 Project 1 Battleship - Group 1

This is project 1 for EECS 168 to build a battleship game. 

## Battleship

Battleship is a two-player, turn-based game where both players secretly place 1 to 6 ships on a 9x10 grid. Each player takes turns to announce where on the opponent's grid they wish to fire. The opponent must announce whether or not one of the ships was hit. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game. 

This game is played through the terminal, with each player taking turns to type in their commands.

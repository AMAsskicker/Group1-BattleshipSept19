#Time Tracking

##Projected Time

We estimated it would take around 20 hours overall, or 5-6 person-hours based on some of our group members' personal experience with a similar project, a connect 4 game written in javascript.

I estimate 20 person-hours to complete but really have no idea! Because figuring-out and learning stuff takes so long and I don't know if that counts.
Very rough (under) estimate of hours so far on initial work (before writing code):  spent around 5 hours Friday and Saturday skimming through a ~250 page book on Python to review how stuff is done. Also spent a couple of hours (I think last Tuesday) to figure out GitHub and push the initial repo. So that's about 7 hours of preparatory stuff but I'm not sure if that counts (??). Same for figuring out the commenting; not adding that time. It seems this is a one-time expense of time that would not be added to similar projects in the future.
Writing code: a couple of hours Saturday eve, Sunday morn (mostly thinking time instead of typing time). Rest will be mostly typing time, though!

I would say time actually spent coding and not prepping
Adina — 09/12/2021
I mix looking up stuff/learning with coding; can't separate the two. They are kind of one and the same, at least when you don't have years of experience.
Which makes the time-tracking exercise kind of bogus but the idea is tho learn to try to estimate, and to learn that in industry (with experienced programmers) probably this would be done.  But I have no idea how long something will take when I'm still learning/inexperienced.

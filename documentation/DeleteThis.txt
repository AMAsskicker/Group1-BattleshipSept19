Suggestion for a rough plan:

# Step 1: rough skeleton/plan for program
# Maybe do step 1 by forking this, and 2 or 3 of us making a 
# branch called personNameSketch
# then discuss and edit one of those branches and merge.

# Once we agree on a TENTATIVE plan for code, go to step 2

# Step 2: Break up the pieces, and assign a piece for 
# each person to pseudocode; does not need to be detailed or complete

# Once we discuss pseudocode and agree it is at least 
# tentatively acceptable, MERGE and go to step 3

# Step 3: Try to divide up roughly equally and Write the Python code

# Step 4: merge and test

# Very hard to split a small project like this, but we 
# are just practicing the process of group work. 

# We should provide each other with links to our forks,
# and update the fork frequently, so we can watch what
# others are doing and maybe use their portion to test 
# our own piece.

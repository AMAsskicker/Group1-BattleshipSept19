Ideas for this file:

Write a brief intro and instructions for running the code.
We should not have to write instructions for playing, because
the instructions/feedback should be printed on screen while 
the players play.

After the intro section above, include this info:

1. Version of Python we used; I suggest 3.8, and then maybe test 
with older version (3.6) on cycle server and also a newer version,
and state here which versions were tested, but also say versions
that are 3.6 and higher are all likely to work.
2. Operating systems we tested
3. Any issues/bugs that need to be addressed still
4. A list of all the files in the repository (?)

so far just 4 files, Battleship-G1.py, README.txt, License, 
and Credits.txt

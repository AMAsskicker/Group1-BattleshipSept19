Estimate of person-hours: 40
  The reason why we guessed that the project completion would take us 40 hours is because Project 1 took about 40 hours. Although this is project is less of a monumental burden (a.k.a. starting from scratch to build a several hundred lined code), we still need to factor in time to understand and interpret the previous group's code, add two major elements, and make a seamless transition between the previous group's code and ours.
  
Design Paradigm:  
  We think the Project 1 team used function-oriented design in their code. When looking through the Project 1 repo, we noticed a lot of function definitions, which tells us this is function-oriented. Function-oriented design requires that the code be split up into components defined by their respective function, and we found plenty of examples of components being defined as functions. Python is known to support function-oriented programming, so we also see a justification as to what language they used, although we don't know what came first--the chicken (language) or the egg (design paradigm)!
